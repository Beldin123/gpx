Package GPX provides a Go language suite of tools for using a subset of callable C functions available for the
Cplex solver. 

This package is intended to be used in conjunction with the separate LPO package 
which provides tools for modelling and solving Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer 
Linear Programming (MILP) problems.
