Package GPX provides a Go language suite of tools for using a subset of callable C functions available for the
Cplex solver. 

This package is intended to be used in conjunction with the separate LPO package 
which provides tools for modelling and solving Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer 
Linear Programming (MILP) problems. GPX assumes that the Cplex header files
and object files as well as a compatible C compiler have been installed and configured
separately on the computer where this package is to be used.
